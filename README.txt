=======================================


INSTRUCTIONS:
Upon installation there will be the Preferences Activity. 
In this Activity you have many options to choose from, all which are fully functional at this point
You can set your background color, or decide to choose an image/take a photo
You can set your Wake, Night, and Nap times
Switch button is active as well

Upon Save, you will be taken to the Main Activity
Here you will see a Sun, Clock, and some icons below.
The Clock is dynamic and should be changing.

BASIC FLOW FOR USER:
1. Set Background Color or Image
2. Set a time for the App to be in "Day Mode" which is your Wake up Time. This is the Apps normal State.
3. Choose a time for the App to go to "Sleep*" which is your Night Time Soothe Mode**. 
4. Should your child nap, or you want the app to "Sleep" a second time, Choose the time here and a second 
soothe mode will run for 1 hour. 
5. Decide whether you want to show the clock icons on the main screen or not. 

*Once the time hits Nap or Night mode, the screens will go through a series of colors and then go to 
sleep until the hour is up (for Nap) or the Wake time is reached. 

**Soothe mode will typically run for 1 hour and then night mode kicks in. Currently this is set at 
a much faster time for testing purposes and will be changed at deployment.
